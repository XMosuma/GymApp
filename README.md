# Workout Plans

# Exercise Library:
You could use a list or grid view to showcase exercises, each with video or animation (using packages like video_player or flare_flutter for animations). Descriptions and target muscle groups can be added as text below each item.
Customizable Plans: Implement a form where users can select exercises and set parameters like reps, sets, and rest time. Storing this in a local database (like SQLite) or syncing it to a backend can help retain these custom plans.
Progress Tracking: Use charts or progress bars (packages like fl_chart) to visualize users' achievements, such as weight lifted or personal bests over time.
Reminders and Scheduling: The flutter_local_notifications package can handle notifications to remind users about their scheduled workouts.
Nutrition

# Meal Logging:
Implement search functionality or barcode scanning (using camera and ml_kit_barcode_scanning) to simplify meal logging.
Macronutrient Breakdown: After logging, display the macros and calories with pie charts or summary tables for daily insights.
Water Intake Tracker: Create a widget where users can easily log glasses of water with a button or slider and track progress.
Diet Management

# Diet Plans: 
Offer pre-made plans that are customizable. Consider storing templates locally or in a backend that users can modify and save as their own.
Shopping Lists: Auto-generate shopping lists based on a diet plan, and display them in a checklist format.
Calorie and Goal Tracking: Let users set calorie/macro goals, then track intake compared to those goals. Use progress bars or circular charts to show how close they are to daily targets.
